This application takes data downloaded from NASA and analyses it to produce a 
plot and a data table. The data table is personalizable because you can change
which columns are displayed. The graph is also personalizable because you can 
change the time range using a slider and you can change the color of the plot.
The data shows that sea levels have been rising over the past 30 years.
